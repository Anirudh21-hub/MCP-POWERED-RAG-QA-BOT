# MCP POWERED RAG QA BOT
This project builds an Agentic RAG chatbot that can read multiple document formats, convert them into embeddings using FAISS, and answer user queries. The agents (Ingestion, Retrieval, LLM Response) communicate via MCP tools, ensuring multi-turn conversational responses with context.
